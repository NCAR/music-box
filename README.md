# Installation
```
pip install acom_music_box
```

# Command line tool
MusicBox provides a command line tool that can run configurations as well as some pre-configured examples. Basic plotting can be done if gnuplot is installed.

Checkout the command line options

```
music_box -h                                        
```

Run an example. Notice that the output, in csv format, is printed to the terminal.

```
music_box -e Chapman
```

Output can be saved to a csv file and printed to the terminal.

```
music_box -e Chapman -o output.csv
```

Output can be saved to a csv file and the terminal output can be suppressed by specifying the `--output-format`

```
music_box --output-format csv -e Chapman -o output.csv
```

Output can be saved to a file as netcdf file when `--output-format` netcdf is passed

```
music_box --output-format netcdf -e Chapman -o output.nc
```

Output can be saved to a file in csv format when a filename is not specified. In this case a timestamped csv file is made

```
music_box --output-format csv -e Chapman
```

Output can be saved to a file in netcdf format when a filename is not specified. In this case a timestamped netcdf file is made

```
music_box --output-format netcdf -e Chapman
```

You can also run your own configuration

```
music_box -c my_config.json
```

## Plotting
Some basic plots can be made to show concentrations throughout the simulation

### matplotlib

```
music_box -e Chapman -o output.csv --plot O1D
```

You can also make multiple plots by specifying groupings of species

```
music_box -e TS1 --plot O3 --plot PAN,HF 
```

Note that the windows may overlap each other

By default all plot units are in `mol m-3`. You can see a list of unit options to specify with `--plot-output-unit`

```
music_box -h
```

It is used like this

```
 music_box -e TS1 --output-format csv --plot O3 --plot-output-unit "ppb"
```

### gnuplot
If you want ascii plots (maybe you're running over ssh and can't view a graphical window), you can set
the plot tool to gnuplo (`--plot-tool gnuplot`) to view some output

```
music_box -e Chapman -o output.csv --plot O1D --plot-tool gnuplot
```

# Development and Contributing

For local development, install `music-box` as an editable installation:

```
pip install -e '.[dev]'
```

## Tests

```
pytest
