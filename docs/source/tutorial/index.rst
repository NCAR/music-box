MusicBox offers a series of tutorial notebooks that guide users from simple workflows to more advanced simulations, available in multiple formats below for ease of access.

Binder (recommended)
----------------------
The MusicBox repository utilizes `Binder <https://mybinder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html#>`_ to allow users to interact with the tutorial notebooks on a `JupyterHub <https://jupyter.org/hub>`_.
Each of the links below will open a JupyterHub set up with all necessary dependencies to run each tutorial:

1. `a basic MusicBox workflow <https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/NCAR/music-box/3ba8be9dc0539a3b44455d95d306c0b97d74bc85?urlpath=lab%2Ftree%2Ftutorial%2F1.%20basic_workflow.ipynb>`_
2. `overriding mechanisms <https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/NCAR/music-box/3ba8be9dc0539a3b44455d95d306c0b97d74bc85?urlpath=lab%2Ftree%2Ftutorial%2F2.%20override_mechanism.ipynb>`_
3. `loading custom box models <https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/NCAR/music-box/3ba8be9dc0539a3b44455d95d306c0b97d74bc85?urlpath=lab%2Ftree%2Ftutorial%2F3.%20loading_custom_box_models.ipynb>`_

Github
--------
For users that wish to directly download local copies of the tutorial notebooks, they are each made available on our Github within the `tutorials <https://github.com/NCAR/music-box/tree/main/tutorial>`_ folder. Each notebook is also linked below:
