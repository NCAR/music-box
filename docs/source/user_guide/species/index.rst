Defining chemical systems
=========================

This section covers the components of a chemical system as defined in MusicBox:

- Species (see :class:`musica.mechanism_configuration.Species`)
- Phases (see :class:`musica.mechanism_configuration.Phase`)
- Reactions (see :class:`musica.mechanism_configuration.Reactions`)
- Mechanisms (see :class:`musica.mechanism_configuration.Mechanism`)


As a reminder, this section assumes you have imported::
   
   import musica.mechanism_configuration as mc

Species
--------
Chemical species are the fundamental units that participate in reactions, they can be defined using::
   
   X = mc.Species(name="X")
   Y = mc.Species(name="Y")
   Z = mc.Species(name="Z")

   species = {"X":X,"Y":Y,"Z":Z}

Species can be initialized with various chemistry-related paramaters (e.g., molecular weight, density, etc.). See the :class:`musica.mechanism_configuration.Species`
documentation for further details.

Phases
-------
Species can be grouped into a phase. At present MUSICA and therefore MusicBox can only support a single gas phase,
but support for more phases is coming in the future::
   
   gas = mc.Phase(name="gas",species=list(species.values()))

Reactions
----------
Reactions are defined using rate-based classes such as :class:`musica.mechanism_configuration.Arrhenius`.
Each class takes a unique set of rate parameters and the participating species::

   arr1 = mc.Arrhenius(name="X->Y", A=4.0e-3, C=50, reactants=[species["X"]], products=[species["Y"]], gas_phase=gas)
   arr2 = mc.Arrhenius(name="Y->Z", A=4.0e-3, C=50, reactants=[species["Y"]], products=[species["Z"]], gas_phase=gas)
   
For passing later on into a Mechanism (see :class:`musica.mechanism_configuration.Mechanism`), it is helpful to store your selected reactions into a dictionary::

   rxns = {r.name: r for r in [arr1, arr2]}

.. note::

   Several other reaction types are made available for use in MusicBox. For a full list of supported reactions types as well as their parameters,
   please see the :ref:`mc:reactions` page in the OpenAtmos Mechanism Configuration documentation.

Mechanisms
----------
A mechanism defines a collection of chemical species, their associated phases, and the reactions between them. Mechanisms can be defined as
follows::

   mechanism = mc.Mechanism(name="tutorial_mechanism", species=list(species.values()), phases=[gas], reactions=list(rxns.values()))
